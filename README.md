# **ELE888: Intelligent Systems Lab Assignments**
## Overview
This repository hosts my ELE888 (Intelligent Systems) lab work—pure Jupyter notebooks in which I’ve built classic machine learning algorithms from scratch and benchmarked them against scikit-learn implementations.

## Notebooks Included

### *Clustering*
Implementation of **k-means**, **Nearest Neighbor**, and **DBSCAN** algorithms from scratch, with comparisons to their scikit-learn counterparts. Includes final results and metrics for both versions. The 3 clustering algorithms were compared against one another for the best performance model on the given coursework dataset.

### *Linear Regression*
Implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using coursework datasets. Covers both standardized and non-standardized data, evaluated via gradient descent. Includes data visualizations and a final comparison with scikit-learn, with recorded metrics.

### *Logistic Regression*
Implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using coursework datasets. Includes experiments with standardized data, batch vs. mini-batch gradient descent, and final comparisons with scikit-learn, with recorded metrics.

### *Neural Networks*
Implementation of neural networks from scratch with two custom structures:  
- **Structure 1:** More layers, fewer neurons  
- **Structure 2:** Single layer, more neurons  
Both structures have the same total number of neurons for fair comparison. Experiments include shuffled vs. unshuffled data, scaled vs. unscaled data, and different activation functions (ReLU and tanh). Also includes an XOR operation using neural network forward propagation.

## Getting Started

1. **Download** the notebooks from this repository.
2. **Open** them using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/).
3. **Run** the cells and explore!

No additional installation or setup is required.
